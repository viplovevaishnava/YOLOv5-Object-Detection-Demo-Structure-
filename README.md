# YOLOv5 Object Detection Demo

This is a lightweight demo showing how object detection pipelines are structured.
The project demonstrates how a YOLOv5-like detection script would be organized.

## Features
- Load an image
- Simulate object detection output
- Clean Python pipeline for CV demos

## Tech Stack
- Python
- OpenCV (for image handling)

## How to Run
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python detect.py
